  ## Build Status



  ## Tech/Framework/Code

  Smorgasbord uses a combination of Javascript, CSS, and HTML to build the website. The use of node.js packages were important throughtout the project. Express, and handlebars were largely implimented throughout the project. A new technology for our team was nodemailer package, wich sends out a confirmation email to those who have signed up for the website.

  ## How to use?

  If a user would go to the depolyed [website]](https://smorgasbord.herokuapp.com/). When a user views the website they first view the homepage where others have previously posted thier favorite restaraunts. When navigating to the login page, there will also be a sign up form, from there the user can post, view, and comment on the entire website.
